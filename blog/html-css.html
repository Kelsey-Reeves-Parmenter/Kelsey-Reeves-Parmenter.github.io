<h1>What is the Box model?</h1>

<p>The box model is a tool to understand CSS spacing of elements and almost like a cheat sheet picture of how to understand how it works when you can read it. The box model is bad up of 4 basic parts. The first being the "content", This can be a text or image that makes the centre of the picture. The next is the padding which is the space between the content and the border and can sometimes act as a backdrop to the content. The Border is the next part of the box model. It is the gap between the margin and the padding. It can act almost like another backdrop to the entire thing and gives the overall sizing of the box. The Margin is the final piece and it controls the overall spacing between the border and the elements around it. There are some examples below with more indepth descriptions.</p>
