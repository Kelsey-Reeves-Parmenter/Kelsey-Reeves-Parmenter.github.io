      <div>
      <h3>My long term plan....</h3>
      <p>
        My long term goal is to just complete the course and hopefully find an aspect I love to bring to the career sector and build upon those skills there. I would love to make a positive impact on my peers and teachers and help them grow alongside me.  
      </p>

    <h3>My limitations and Strenghts in bootcamp</h3>
      <p>
        I think my strengths have only increased and my limitations diminished.  
        For example for strengths I feel like I am much more mindful of myself and how I feel and why. It is really important that when I feel overwhelmed I understand why and from understanding why I can fix it whether that is just taking a short break and coming back and asking for help. I also feel that I have gotten much better at comparing myself to others. Now instead of saying "Wow their work is much better" I can instead look at it and see what they did differently to me and how I can use those methods to improve my work in the future and I think this mindset will really help me in bootcamp. 
      </p>

    <h3>My biggest non-technical challenge</h3>
      <p>
        I think staying on top of time and the material will be really challenging for me having a new born takes a lot of time and effort away from other things. However I think it will make me a stronger worker and more patient and understanding worker and being able to juggle time management is a super important skill. 
      </p>

      <div>
        <h3>Non-technical development</h3>
        <p>
          I really want to work on my will power and energy that I bring to the table through the course and want to improve my shy and anxious side so I become better at working in groups and presenting myself to others and being proud of my work and my journey instead of looking down on it because others are doing better than me in some aspects. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Expectations from the Bootcamp team</h3>
        <p>
          I expect them to be really involved and supportive when I ask for it. I don't expect them to read my mind and figure out that I am struggling but when I am and ask I really want them to make sure I understand the subject and help me push and strive to be my best that I can be. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>My own Expectations</h3>
        <p>
          want to get much better at asking others for help instead of being prideful and stubborn and trying to figure it out on my own. By being a better communicator at when I am struggling I can improve and so when I see others struggling I have the knowledge and awareness to help others. I also want to being a bit more disciplined with my time, starting earlier and finishing later just to manage my time and deadlines are going to be super important for me.
