      <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths reflection.</h1>
    
      <h3>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h3> 

       <p> I worked as a Nightfill assistant at countdown and they would force a co-worker that was put on Light duties due to injuries to do heavy lifting and pulling of pallets on pallet jacks. In my mind this was just an abuse of power and taking advantage of someone that was new to the job and didn't know any better. The values I weighed up was fairness, Equality, caring, and Trustworthiness it wasn't fair that he was being convinced that it was his tasks and if it was anyone else that knew any better they wouldn't have been placed on those tasks. The person was New and I cared about his welfare and didn't want to see him injured and if I can't be trusted to speak up when I see someone being mistreated then I won't be able to be trusted with running a shift myself. I think this was the correct decision as it saved him from getting injured and taken advantage of by the shift manager on the shift as he was only doing it so more work would be done and making himself look better in the eyes of the store manager. I would always make that decision even though it was against my managers wishes and it was the correct thing to do so he didn't hurt himself severely as he was put on light duties due to Back issues.</p>

       <h3>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity. </h3>
      <p>Growing up in a very tight knit family always made me appreciate the concept of family and close friends highly. My father's side of the family is very militaristic going back many generations of both Law enforcement and military which has given me a strong basis of discipline and comradery when doing things like Sports, school groups and General friend groups. I have a strong sense of family first and loyalty due to recently becoming a father. I find that because of my upbringing I am very kind hearted and light hearted. I love to see the best in people and situations. This means sometimes I will try laugh about a setback than feeling engulfed by dread at it. </p>
      
      <h3>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey. </h3>
    <p>My strengths would be discipline and perseverance and the ability to enjoy a challenge instead of get frustrated quickly and be overwhelmed by it and this will mean that I will be able to build good habits and work through challenges to overcome them to become better in my studies.</p>

      <h3>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h3>
      <p>I can be very shy and timid with plenty of anxiety. I prefer when people try engage with me first off before opening up completely. This will make it harder for people to work with me during the learning process and make it potentially harder for people to employ me based on first time meetings where I might be uncomfortable.</p>

      <h3>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>

      <p>When I worked Night fill, The 2IC and the Manager would conflict about tasks such as making the displays and what Aisles to complete and who is assigned to which. Me and the manager would be completing tasks very quickly and effectively but the 2IC and his team would keep coming to us and ask us to complete their tasks such as dropping their pallets and filling their aisles because we knew them more intimately which caused a lot of frustration. In the end we decided to send them to other easier Aisles just to get work done instead of arguing about the most effective way to do it. I think this was both positive as we just kept working and we finished in the end however it was a negative also as they didnâ€™t learn the aisles and might be tempted to do the same thing in the future. I think we could have made them complete those Aisles with no time constraints and doing their own pallets as this mean they could learn and build their knowledge instead of asking others and relying on others to do the work for them and using the time pressure as an excuse.</p>
