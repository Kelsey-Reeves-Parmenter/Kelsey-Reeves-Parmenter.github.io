      <h1>EQ VS IQ</h1>
      
      <h3>What is emotional intelligence?</h3>
      <p>The textbook definition is "the capacity to be aware of, control, and express one's emotions, and to handle interpersonal relationships judiciously and empathetically." 

        To me this is the ability to be in an out of body state when you get emotional and be able to stop and recognize simple factors like Why am I emotional. How am I being emotional and What outcome is this emotion going to have on myself and others. It also is the ability to recognize and interpret relationships properly and being able to understand how others are feeling and engage and act in a manner appropriate to the situation.</p>

        <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
        <p>IQ is an assessment or scale for "raw" intelligence, This is normally problem solving or memory retention. However EQ is your emotional intelligence or understanding of how your feelings and emotional state will affect yourself and others around you either positively or negatively.</p>

        <h3>Why is this important?</h3>
        <p>EQ is really important because being able to recognize your own emotions allows you to not make poorly influence snap judgements or decisions. It also allows you to work better with others because able to understand how they are feeling or how you are making them feel is really important and being able to improve upon that means there will be better workflow and connections between the people around you and even your own mental state overall.</p>
