  <h1>Reflecting on the Importance of Core Skills</h1>
  </div>
<div>
<h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
  <p>
    Firstly I found that I have a more fragile ego than I intially imagined, I got very frustrated and overwhelmed quicker than I imagined which leads me to my second point of that when I do get overwhelmed I will not ask questions sometimes out of pride or fear of looking dim witted compared to others. Finally I think that I improved on both of these through my foundation journey, I learnt to ask my teachers and peers for help instead of trying to figure it out myself. I am usually very quick to ask questions but I just wanted to prove myself to myself that I was smart enough to do it on my own, but in reality that isn't what was important it was the Will to complete it and the sense of mind to ask for help when I needed it.

<h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
  <p>
    Values are really important having good values can mean that you are disciplined, hardworking, punctual and more. This is ideal for learning and programming, holding these values to great importance means you are ontime, ready to learn/work, with a good mindset and mood which benefits yourself and others. Having Empathy is extremely important being able to understand and share feelings is sometimes really hard to do but being able to put yourself in someone elses shoes and help them through the bad thoughts and situations not only makes you a great programmer and student but also a genuinely good person that people want to be around. Finally Self-awareness which I would argue is one of the hardest skills as you can delude yourself into thinking you are the best or the worst depending on your mindset. But having the Self-awareness to realise you are learning and realise you are getting better and better everyday is so good for your mental health and fortitude and when something does go wrong you can look back at how far you have come and that can give you the will power to move forward or the oppisite if you are being a really nasty person you can build the self awareness to realise this and make yourself a better student and coworker which only builds a better environment for yourself and others.

<h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
  <p>
    I was surprised by the depth and importance of core learning, Being able to be mindful of yourself and others really gives the motivation and energy to be a better person. Also knowing that if i bring a "yet" mindset to the table I can be a much better learner. When I reach a problem that I dont know how to fix instead of flat out saying "I dont know how to do this" and then giving up. By adding a "yet" on the end it gives me the motivation to reach out and go through methods of how to fix this problem or how to improve and that just really helps with my mental state when I hit a major roadblock this has saved me many times and its amazing how your brain can be so polar at your best and worst.

<h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
  <p>
    The hardest part of core learning is simply opening up to yourself, Being honest and more mindful can be really hard especially to yourself and opening up and trying to actively improve yourself is challenging. But as I started to learn more and more about myself and my learning journey it was easier and easier to connect with these core concepts.

<h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
  <p>
    I think its because its easier to train someone how to use a computer than train them to be a good fit for the company a common expression I have heard is "hire for fit and train for skills". If a company uses a different engine or system than what I have trained in I can use my base knowledge to adapt and learn it. However during that time you want to make sure that the person "fits" with the values of the company and has the mindset to be willing to learn and improve. There is alot of teamwork and sharing in coding, More than I intially realised so it is really important to be strong in your mentality, social skills and mindfulness more so than how good you are with being locked in a room and typing up code all day long.

<h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
  <p>
    I feel like core learning is more valuable than learning the code which is really ironic considering its something intially I thought was a bit of a waste of time. But by seeing how great the facilitators are and how they love to help us better ourselves it shows the importance of the core skills they have learnt and developed. Also I am finding myself being way more mindful of my actions, It has helped so much on my learning journey by giving me the confidence to know that I can learn and I will learn if I put the effort in and break through the mental barriers that might have stopped me before.
