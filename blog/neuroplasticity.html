      <h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>
<div>
    <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
    <h3>How does understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefit you? </h3>
    <p>Neuroplasticity is about the growth and development of your brain at all stages and points of life, If you understand this concept you can put it into practice by doing things such as being mindful, practicing knowing you will learn if you keep at it and many other things. By understanding the principles of it you understand that learning and growth isn't fixed and there isn't a cut off point for it but itâ€™s a constant evolution and growth. </p>

  <h3>How might you engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</h3>
    <p>"Use it or lose it" and "Use it and improve it" are great principles of how neuroplasticity works, by using your skill and developing it constantly it will grow and strengthen alongside those pathways that are being developed. By not using or nurturing your skills it will wither and degrade as that pathway is no longer being used. So knowing that good constant practice can help make a world of difference and using that to your benefit is really important </p>

  <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
<p>Practice will help make perfect. By imaging doing an act or even bettering doing that activity it will improve your Neuroplasticity and by doing this with increased intensity and constant for long engaged periods of time will see significant results over small and infrequent bursts of activity. Getting into a routine for this practice is important, by being consistent it will make sure those pathways are being used and building. By being specific to what you are trying to improve will also really improve your ability at it. Take a learning to kick a football as an example. Learning how to pass and learning how to take a corner are very different actions and keeping it specific will help improve your skills. </p>

<h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
  <h3>What it is and why it is relevant?</h3>
  <p>Growth mindset is the idea that keeping the mindset when learning that you will continue to grow and improve and you are never in a fixed position when it comes to learning and being able to improve, By doing this you will be mindful of your progress and won't be disheartened when it comes to learning and that keeping up your effort will mean that you will improve past those that do not. </p>
    
<h3>The surprising nature of Growth mindset</h3>
<p>The power of believing in yourself and how wanting to learn and putting in effort even when you struggle is so important. It also really intrigues me how your brain can be so controlled by emotion and societal pressures thinking that you can't learn something like math because you are worse than others at it means that you won't want to learn it but by thinking you can grow and become the best actually affects your ability to learn and become the best and that just changes my whole outlook on learning. </p>

<h3>How can you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
<p>By simply knowing that I can ALWAYS improve if I keep my head up and think positive of myself, Simple things like knowing it can take some time and effort but if I just wake up with the idea that I am learning and I am growing to better myself and those around me lifts my spirits and I can incorporate this by reminding myself during my mindfulness sessions and also when I complete a task or submit my work I can ask myself if this is my best work or if I can improve or what can I improve and constantly seek the ability to better myself. </p>
