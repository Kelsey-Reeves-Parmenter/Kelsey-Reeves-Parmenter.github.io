<h1>Problem Solving</h1>

<div>
 <h3>Simple solutions are the best</h3>  
    <p>
      On one of the DOM manipulation games I got stuck on the counting portion of the challenge. My invisible tokens were not counting properly and I was stuck for a good 15 minutes. I asked Jojo to take a look at it so we decided to jump into a call at 3:30, I felt I could do it myself so I kept charging on I checked a couple of threads and couldnt crack it. So I thought I would show my partner, I loaded up the game and the code and read through each part of code and showed her what it did. As I was reading through my code I finally spotted it. The infamous mistake, I forgot to put a capital on my "update<span style="color:red">C</span>ounts" line. I felt a mix of relief and stupidity missing such a basic mistake that had got me caught up for so long. I learnt that the rubber ducky method although simple is priceless. In a rush your brain doesn't really care about the little things but by slowing down so I didn't skim pass the little things it was as simple as holding the shift key for a singular key press.

<h3>Elegent solutions are just as good.</h3>
  <p> 
    I was stuck on the "concatMyArray" question in the Function.js Kata for a while. I couldn't really find the right way to break down the strings and add them back together, But I asked Kyle in my Cohort for help and he came to the rescue and worked through it with me helping me first understand what .join does and then how to use it in the question. It was a very simple and elegant solotion of just one line of code <span style="color :red"> "return arrayOfStrings.join("");"</span> was all it took and it felt super satisifying getting a question that I was struggling with, breaking it down and completeing the challenge.

<h3>My experience with Different types of Problem solving in coding</h3>
  <p>
    There are plenty of different ways to solve problems and similarly there are lots of different ways to problem solve. My favourite is "Rubber ducky" being super easy to use and work through. I am not too confident with Pseudocode because alot of the time I struggle with finding what to do before even knowing how to do it. I always try something before I do anything else as sometimes I trigger or stumble onto the right answer. Reading error messages are a bit hit or miss for me sometimes they will frustrate me and sometimes I will find them crystal clear. Console logging is a staple for me and I use it near constantly when im stuck to see what the computer is seeing and how I can make it what I want it to see. Google is my bread and butter and I use it 100% of the time before I even ask a question I will just ask it into google first, However some websites can be technically challenging for me and hard to follow. I love asking for help from Jojo and Benjamin because they always give me a really good and in depth answer and I feel like I know something 10x better by going through it with them although I am a little shy to ask sometimes. I love asking my peers for answers, Kyle and Brennen are really good at helping me work through questions and I get some really good pointers from other people also. I struggle to reflect sometimes I will be in too much of a rush to really let it sink in and it will wash over me.
